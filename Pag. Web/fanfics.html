                This is a terrible idea. Words cannot express how awful of an idea this is. But Oswald knows he’ll never
                have Ed any other way. “If we're going to do this,” Oswald says firmly, “there should be some rules.”

                Four years after their friendship imploded in hatred and heartbreak, the Riddler has a terribly tempting
                suggestion: sex, no strings attached.

                Or: ten years down the line, literally everyone knows the Riddler is in love with the Penguin… except
                the two of them.

                Oswald becomes Jerome's... whatever while sat in Arkham, waiting to plan his escape so he can safely get
                at Sofia Falcone and rescue his boy, Martin. He comes to terms with the arrangement quicker than
                expected. It's not awful, and Jerome's influence in the asylum helps make his stay more tolerable than
                it was the first time. It's not a huge price to pay. <br>
                He's working hard to move past Edward and their back and forth betrayals and he's pretty proud of
                himself for it. <br>
                But his eyes catch the shine of those idiotic glasses that frame his nose so well, and Oswald almost
                falls right out of Jerome's lap when he realizes that Edward has been arrested too. He's there.
                Imprisoned with Oswald... again. Because the last time they'd been locked up together had gone so well.
